# Potential 0day vulnerabilities as seen in web logs.

As I monitor attrition.org web logs, I occasionally see exploit attempts that I cannot match to a known vulnerability in [VulnDB](https://flashpoint.io/ignite/vulnerability-management/). I will create a new issue for each one in hopes that someone can figure out more information. In each case I not only check VulnDB, which is 100%+ CVE complete, but a quick Google search. If no relevant hits or information, it will land here.
